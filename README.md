Koding Hackathon 2014
=====================

This is the repo for my 2014 Koding Hackathon (https://koding.com/Hackathon) submission that can be found live at http://udkk231b936d.danm36.koding.io/index.html.

Project Idea
============

My project is to aim to fulfil proposed theme number 2 - introducing software development to a beginner. I will do this by creating a JavaScript/Canvas programming tool, allowing users to connect various nodes representing blocks of JavaScript together and then executing the resulting chain. In addition, this will generate actual JavaScript code from this.

The tool will have breakpoint and stepping functionality, as well as 'slow execution', whereby the user can see the code executing in real time, including mathematical operations and variable accessing.

Most of the generated code will be able to run without any explicit modification from the user outside the tool, although there will be some features - mostly related to advanced drawing like drawing on a second canvas - that will be restricted to the tool initially.

Should this project prove successful, and maybe even if not, I hope to expand this further into a full developmental IDE of sorts to help teach people JavaScript and - maybe in the future - other languages like Python, Perl and PHP. Maybe even compiled languages like Java or C#, as the displayed 'real code' is never truly ran.

Stretch Goals
=============

- To have the program parse supplied JavaScript and generate a node path from this as a result
- Handle arrays in an aesthetically pleasing fashion
- Handle objects in an aesthetically pleasing fashion
- Voiced/Pop-up[ed?] and directed tutorial, introducing the user to the tool and JavaScript
