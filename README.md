Koding Hackathon 2014
=====================

This is the repo for my 2014 Koding Hackathon (https://koding.com/Hackathon) submission that can be found live at http://danm36.koding.io/wirecoder/.

## Project Idea

My project is to aim to fulfil the proposed theme "introducing software development to a beginner". I have done this by creating a JavaScript/Canvas programming tool, allowing users to connect various nodes representing blocks of JavaScript together and then executing the resulting chain. In addition, this tool then generates actual valid JavaScript code that the user may then use elsewhere.

This tool also features both breakpoint and stepping functionality, as well as 'slow execution', whereby the user can see the code executing in real time.

Should this project prove successful, and maybe even if not, I hope to expand this further into a full developmental IDE of sorts to help teach people JavaScript and - maybe in the future - other languages like Python, Perl and PHP. Maybe even compiled languages like Java or C#, as the displayed 'real code' is never actually ran. I may also in the future add canvas modification capabilities, allowing the nodes to draw to a smaller canvas. Another feature I may add is a voiced and directed introductory tutorial to the tool, should the user request it.
